# a somnolence so dense it seemed to inhibit breathing
## for two performers

### Programme Note

The title of the work comes from Joan Didion’s South and West: From a Notebook.

> _“A somnolence so dense it seemed to inhibit breathing hung over Hattiesburg, Mississippi, at two or three o’clock of that Sunday afternoon.There was no place to get lunch, no place to get gas. On the wide leafy streets the white houses were set back. Sometimes I would see a face at a window. I saw noone on the streets.”_

The work is, throughout, restrained yet unyielding. Every push has an equal pull, and there should be a feeling throughout that the sound is on the cusp of dissipating––that it never quite actualised.
